This is a random input simulator. Meant for keeping screen alive for less than 2 hours really.  

If you kill the exe with the command below, just double click to relaunch it when you want to run it.

CTRL SHIFT W     (all together) is what launches input
CTRL SHIFT E     (all together) kills the exe.
